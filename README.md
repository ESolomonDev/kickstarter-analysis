## Overview of Project
This report contains data pertaining to 4000 Kickstarter campaigns 
---
### Purpose
  The purpose of this project was to provide data-based insight into what separates failed Kickstarter campaigns from successful ones. Particularly Kickstarter campaigns involving fundraising for theater productions. The data was provided in excel format of 4113 Kickstarter campaigns with around 14 data points collected and 5 additional data points extrapolated for readability between the year 2009 and 2017.

## Analysis and Challenges

  The data provided some very interesting and potentially useful insights on Kickstarter campaigns. The overwhelming number of campaigns where for under $5000 (close to 70% of the fundraising campaigns provided). The campaigns that had the highest success rate had goals under $1000 being successful %76 of the time. Meaning 3/4ths of all campaigns under $1000 were successful. The second most successful bracket of campaigns aimed to raise between $1000 to $5000, those campaigns had a success rate of nearly 73%. It is important to note the average Kickstarter campaign is successful about 66% of the time so roughly 2/3rds of campaigns are successful.

## Results

---
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. Kickstarter campaigns launched in summer months are more likely to be successful
  2. Kickstarter campaigns launched in winter months are less likely to be successful
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The smaller the goal the more likely a Kickstarter campaign is to meet its goal.
Generally, the most successful Kickstarter campaigns are under $1,000 with a success rate just under 76%. The second most successful campaigns in the $1000 to $4999 range with a success rate just under 73%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We donâ€™t know how complete the data is, was there only 4000 Kickstarter campaigns in that time period?
The data for the number of cancelled Kickstarter campaigns for October are missing. 
The data seems to be several years old. A lot has changed the past couple years particularly pertaining to theater, more recent up to date, especially data from 2020 onward.
There does not seem to be nearly as many Kickstarter campaigns over $15000 so the predictions for Kickstarter campaigns would not be as accurate
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

number_of_backers vs % of successful campaigns perhaps by each bracket of fundraising goals to see how many backers are required to reasonably to attain each goal bracket (i.e. how many backers for a successful goal of $35000)
